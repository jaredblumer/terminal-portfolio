# Terminal Portfolio by Jared Blumer

Welcome to my terminal-inspired portfolio! This interactive experience simulates a terminal interface and showcases my work as a full-stack engineer with a focus on React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Rails.

The application is deployed using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **AWS Fargate**.
