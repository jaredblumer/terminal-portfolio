                Hello, my name is Jared Blumer (he/him)!
            </p>
            <p>
                With over five years of experience as a full-stack software engineer and data analyst,
                I have developed a versatile skill set that enables me to create reliable, scalable,
                and user-friendly web applications using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a lifelong learner, driven by the principles of Deep Work and the Growth Mindset.
                Inspired by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck, I believe that "Effort is what makes you smart or talented."
                This belief fuels my dedication to continuous improvement and tackling new challenges in the tech industry.
            </p>
